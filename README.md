<h2>Tip Calculator Documentation</h2>

This project is a tip calculator and bill splitting tool implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to calculate the tip based on the bill amount and a selected percentage, as well as splitting the bill among a user-defined number of people.

Users can input the bill amount in the "Bill" field.
Users can select the desired tip percentage using a slider control.
The tip amount and the total bill including the tip are automatically updated as the user adjusts the tip percentage.
The selected tip percentage is displayed alongside the slider control.
The result is displayed in the "Tip" and "Total" sections.

<h3>Bill Splitting</h3>

Users can select the number of people to split the bill among using a slider control.
The amount per person, calculated by dividing the total bill by the selected number of people, is automatically computed.
The selected number of people is displayed alongside the slider control.
